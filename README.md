# Chrono – Building My Own Git in Python
My from-scratch implementation of Git

Goal: Deep understanding of Git internals (objects, trees, index, commits, refs) + DSA practice.

## Features (to be implemented)
- [ ] git init
- [ ] hash-object & cat-file
- [ ] log, checkout, ls-tree
- [ ] branches, tags, refs
- [ ] add, status, commit

Progress: Just starting!
